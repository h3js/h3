# Utils

> Keep your severs light and fast with composables.

H3 is a composable framework. Instead of providing a big core, you start with a lightweight [app instance](/guide/app) and for every functionality, there is either a built-in utility or you can make yours.

Composable utilities have huge advantages comparing to traditional plugin/middleware approaches:

✅ Your server only includes and runs the code that is needed <br>
✅ You can extend your server functionality easily without adding global plugins <br>
✅ The usage is explicit and clean with less global middleware and plugins <br>

All utilities, have access to [event object](/guide/event). This way they can access incoming request and use a shared context with `event.context`.
