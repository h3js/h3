> Utilities to access incoming request

<!-- automd:jsdocs src="../../src/utils/request.ts" -->

### `assertMethod(event, expected, allowHead?)`

Asserts that the incoming request method is of the expected type using `isMethod`.

If the method is not allowed, it will throw a 405 error with the message "HTTP method is not allowed".

### `getHeader(event, name)`

Get a request header by name.

### `getHeaders(event)`

Get the request headers object.

Array headers are joined with a comma.

### `getQuery(event)`

Get query the params object from the request URL parsed with [unjs/ufo](https://ufo.unjs.io).

### `getRequestHeader(event, name)`

Get a request header by name.

### `getRequestHeaders(event)`

Get the request headers object.

Array headers are joined with a comma.

### `getRequestHost(event, opts: { xForwardedHost? })`

Get the request hostname.

If `xForwardedHost` is `true`, it will use the `x-forwarded-host` header if it exists.

If no host header is found, it will default to "localhost".

### `getRequestIP(event)`

Try to get the client IP address from the incoming request.

If `xForwardedFor` is `true`, it will use the `x-forwarded-for` header if it exists.

### `getRequestProtocol(event, opts: { xForwardedProto? })`

Get the request protocol.

If `x-forwarded-proto` header is set to "https", it will return "https". You can disable this behavior by setting `xForwardedProto` to `false`.

If protocol cannot be determined, it will default to "http".

### `getRequestURL(event, opts: { xForwardedHost?, xForwardedProto? })`

Generated the full incoming request URL using `getRequestProtocol`, `getRequestHost` and `event.path`.

If `xForwardedHost` is `true`, it will use the `x-forwarded-host` header if it exists.

If `xForwardedProto` is `false`, it will not use the `x-forwarded-proto` header.

### `getRouterParam(event, name, opts: { decode? })`

Get a matched route param by name.

### `getRouterParams(event, opts: { decode? })`

Get matched route params.

If `decode` option is `true`, it will decode the matched route params using `decodeURI`.

### `getValidatedQuery(event, validate)`

Get the query param from the request URL parsed with [unjs/ufo](https://ufo.unjs.io) and validated with validate function.

### `getValidatedRouterParams(event, validate, opts: { decode? })`

Get matched route params and validate with validate function.

### `isMethod(event, expected, allowHead?)`

Checks if the incoming request method is of the expected type.

If `allowHead` is `true`, it will allow `HEAD` requests to pass if the expected method is `GET`.

### `toWebRequest(event)`

Convert the H3Event to a WebRequest object.

**NOTE:** This function is not stable and might have edge cases that are not handled properly.

### `getRequestFingerprint(event, opts)`

## Body utils

<!-- automd:jsdocs src="../../src/utils/body.ts" -->

### `getRequestWebStream(event)`

Captures a stream from a request.

### `readBody(event, options: { strict? })`

Reads request body and tries to safely parse using [destr](https://github.com/unjs/destr).

### `readFormData(event)`

Constructs a FormData object from an event, after converting it to a a web request.

### `readMultipartFormData(event)`

Tries to read and parse the body of a an H3Event as multipart form.

### `readRawBody(event, encoding)`

Reads body of the request and returns encoded raw string (default), or `Buffer` if encoding is falsy.

### `readValidatedBody(event, validate)`

Tries to read the request body via `readBody`, then uses the provided validation function and either throws a validation error or returns the result.
