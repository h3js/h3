# Nightly Builds

You can opt-in to early test latest h3 changes using automated nightly release channel.

If you are directly using `h3` as a dependency in your project:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "h3": "npm:h3-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

If you are using a framework (for example [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) or [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/)) that is using `h3`:

pnpm and yarn:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "h3": "npm:h3-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

npm:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "h3": "npm:h3-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Make sure to recreate lockfile and `node_modules` after reinstall to avoid hoisting issues.
