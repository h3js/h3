# Getting Started

> Getting started with h3

## Overview

h3 (short for HTTP, pronounced as /eɪtʃθriː/, like h-3) is a lightweight, ultra fast and [composable](/utils) server framework for JavaScript based on Web standards working on any JavaScript runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are reading h3 version 2 (release candidate) docs.

Check out [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) for a full featured server toolkit.
::

## Quick Start

Install `h3` as a dependency:

:pm-install{name="h3"}

Create a new file `server.mjs`:

```ts [server.mjs]
import { H3, serve } from "h3";

const app = new H3();

app.get("/", () => "⚡️ Tadaa!");

serve(app, { port: 3000 });
```

Then, run the server using your favorite runtime:

::code-group

```bash [node]
node --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [deno]
deno run -A --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [bun]
bun run --watch server.mjs
```

::

And tadaa! We have a web server running locally.

### What happened?

Okay, let's now break down our hello world example.

We first created an [h3 app instance](/guide/app) using `new H3()`:

```ts
const app = new H3(/* optional config */);
```

`app` is a tiny server capable of matching routes, generating response and handling lifecycle hooks such as errors.

Then we create register a route for handling HTTP GET requests to `/` path.

```ts
app.get("/", () => {
  return { message: "⚡️ Tadaa!" };
});
```

::tip
Router is powered by [🌳 rou3](https://github.com/unjs/rou3), an ultra fast and tiny route matcher engine.
::

In h3 event handlers, all you have to do to make a response, is to simply return it! Responses can be simple **string**, **JSON object**, **binary data**, **stream**, **error**, ... or standard [Web Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response).

:read-more{title="response types" to="/guide/handler#responses-types"}

Finally we use `serve` method to start the server listener.

::tip
Serve method is powered by [💥 srvx](https://srvx.unjs.io/).

<br> Based on runtime and export conditions, correct adapter will be auto loaded.
<br>You can also directly export or use `app.fetch(request)`.
::

### Using from CDN

You can directly import h3 from CDN. This method can be used for Bun, Deno and other runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers (you need an adapter).

```js
import { H3, toWebHandler } from "https://esm.sh/h3";

const app = new H3();

export const fetch = app.fetch;
```

## Run and deploy

Using `serve(app, options?)` you can easily run h3 apps in [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtimes.

With the main h3 app instance you have [`app.fetch`](/guide/app#appfetchrequest-init-context) which can be directly used to run h3 apps in any web-compatible runtime or even directly called for testing purposes.

:read-more{to="/guide/app#appfetchrequest-init-context" title="app.fetch"}

```js [test.mjs]
import { H3, serve } from "h3";

const app = new H3().get("/", () => "⚡️ Tadaa!");

// Test without listening
const response = await app.fetch("/");
console.log(await response.text());
```
