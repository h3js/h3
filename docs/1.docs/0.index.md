# Getting Started

> Getting started with H3

## Overview

H3 (short for HTTP, pronounced as /eɪtʃθriː/, like h-3) is a lightweight, ultra-fast and [composable](/utils) server framework for JavaScript based on Web standards working on any JavaScript runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are currently reading H3 version 2 (beta) documentation. See [v1.h3.dev](https://v1.h3.dev/) for older docs.

## Quick Start

Install `h3` as a dependency:

:pm-install{name="h3"}

Create a new file `server.mjs`:

```ts [server.mjs]
import { H3, serve } from "h3";

const app = new H3().get("/", () => "⚡️ Tadaa!");

serve(app, { port: 3000 });
```

Then, run the server using your favorite runtime:

::code-group

```bash [node]
node --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [deno]
deno run -A --watch ./server.mjs
```

```bash [bun]
bun run --watch server.mjs
```

::

And tadaa! We have a web server running locally.

### What Happened?

Okay, let's now break down our hello world example.

We first created an [H3 App Instance](/guide/app) using `new H3()`:

```ts
const app = new H3();
```

`app` is a tiny server capable of matching routes, running middleware, generating response and handling lifecycle hooks such as errors.

Then we add a route for handling HTTP GET requests to `/` path.

```ts
app.get("/", () => {
  return { message: "⚡️ Tadaa!" };
});
```

::tip
Routing is powered by [🌳 Rou3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3), an ultra-fast and tiny route matcher engine.
::

In H3 event handlers, all you have to do to make a response, is to simply return the response body value!

Responses can be simple **String**, **JSON object**, **Binary data**, **Stream**, **Error**, ... or standard [Web Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response).

:read-more{title="Response Types" to="/guide/handler#responses-types"}

Finally we use `serve` method to start the server listener.

::tip
Serve method is powered by [💥 srvx](https://srvx.h3.dev/).
<br>Based on runtime and export conditions, correct adapter will be auto loaded.
::

### Using H3 from CDN

You can directly import h3 from CDN. This method can be used for Bun, Deno and other runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers (you need an adapter).

```js
import { H3 } from "https://esm.sh/h3";

const app = new H3();

export const fetch = app.fetch;
```

## Run and Deploy

Using `serve(app, options?)` you can easily run H3 apps various runtimes, including [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

:read-more{to="https://srvx.h3.dev/guide/options" title="Srvx Server Options"}

With the main H3 app instance you have [`app.fetch`](/guide/app#appfetchrequest-init) which can be directly used to run H3 apps in any web-compatible runtime or even directly called for testing purposes.

:read-more{to="/guide/app#appfetchrequest-init" title="app.fetch"}

```js [test.mjs]
import { H3, serve } from "h3";

const app = new H3().get("/", () => "⚡️ Tadaa!");

// Test without listening
const response = await app.fetch("/");
console.log(await response.text());
```
