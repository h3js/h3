The [`app` instance](/concepts/app) created by `h3` uses a middleware stack with the ability to match route prefix and apply matched middleware.

To opt-in using a more advanced and convenient routing system, we can create a router instance and register it to app instance.

```ts
import { createApp, eventHandler, createRouter } from "h3";

const app = createApp();

const router = createRouter()
  .get(
    "/",
    eventHandler(() => "Hello World!"),
  )
  .get(
    "/hello/:name",
    eventHandler((event) => `Hello ${event.context.params.name}!`),
  );

app.use(router);
```

**Tip:** We can register the same route more than once with different methods.

Routes are internally stored in a [Radix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) and matched using [unjs/radix3](https://github.com/unjs/radix3).

For using nested routers, see [this example](./examples/nested-router.ts)
