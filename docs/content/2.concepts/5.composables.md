title: Composables
description:
---

H3 has a concept of composable utilities that accept `event` (from `eventHandler((event) => {})`) as their first argument. This has several performance benefits over injecting them to `event` or `app` instances in global middleware commonly used in Node.js frameworks, such as Express. This concept means only required code is evaluated and bundled, and the rest of the utilities can be tree-shaken when not used.
