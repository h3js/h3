Every H3 server has at least one app instance. It is the beating hearth of your server.

## Initializing an App

You can create a new H3 app instance using [`createApp`](/utilities/create-app) utility:

```js [app.mjs]
import { createApp } from "h3";

const app = createApp();
```

Then, everything will be connected to this app instance like [event handlers](/concepts/event-handler), [middlewares](/concepts/middleware) or [routers](/concepts/router).

## Setting Global Options

You can pass global app configuration when initializing an app:

```js
const app = createApp({
  debug: true,
});
```

:read-more{to="/api/app/create-app"}

## Setting Global Hooks

When initializing an H3 app, you can register global hooks:

- `onError`
- `onRequest`
- `onBeforeResponse`
- `onAfterResponse`

These hooks are called for every request and can be used to add global logic to your app such as logging, error handling, etc.

```js
const app = createApp({
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
  onRequest: (event) => {
    console.log("Request:", event.path);
  },
});
```

## Advanced Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section is for advanced users only. You can safely skip it for now.

H3 app instance has some additional properties. However it is usually not recommended to directly access them unless you know what are you doing!

- `app.stack`: An ordered array of currently registered event handlers.
  - Each item has `route` and `handler` properties.
- `app.options`: Global options object provided when initializing the app
- `app.handler`: Direct stack handler function (unsafe)
