description: Install H3 to your project and start your server.
---

You can install `h3` dependency from [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/h3) to your project, new or existing, using your favorite package manager:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install h3
```

```bash [bun]
bun i h3
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add h3
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add h3
```

::

Then you can import `h3` to your project:

```ts
import { } from "h3";
```

Finally, you can start your server:

```terminal
npx --yes listhen -w --open ./<entry>.ts
```

where `<entry>` is the name of your entry file.

> [!TIP]
> You can add `npx --yes listhen -w --open ./<entry>.ts` to a `dev` script in your `package.json` file to make it easier to run your server.
